In this specific audit, the objective is to assess the integrity, and accuracy of the data stored in the database. The data in the database was collected by a team of surveyors.

In this analysis, I carried out a detailed investigation that involves analyzing the difference between the auditors report and the data collected in the field and try and Identify errors and any biasness in the data. I will try to access the accuracy of the data, thereby ensuring that the information can be relied upon for decision-making and governance.

In this analysis, I investigated the differences that exist in between the auditor scores in his report and the scores collected by the surveyors.
